# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

“Preserving Cultural Heritage through Interactive Simulations”

About
	Our software is envisioned as a dynamic online platform where users can explore, learn, and immerse themselves in the art of traditional craftsmanship through advanced simulations. Serving as an educational resource, the platform offers a deep dive into the historical and scientific significance of these crafts. With interactive virtual experiences, users can gain practical insights and skills, engaging with the creative process in a hands-on, yet digital format—allowing for an enriched learning experience without the need for physical resources.


User Guidelines
The video tutorials initially provided are for users to view and understand the crafting process in real time. 
The information provided about each artefact has been compiled after a thorough research into the artefact’s history and traditional use. All rights to this information belong to UG2 Team 7.
The interactive simulation environment lets users experiment with different design patterns on their canvas, while also letting them project a 3D simulation of the same.
Users are encouraged to maintain decorum while interacting with the online community to ensure a friendly and overall pleasant experience. 
A healthy competitive spirit during our online competitions is requested. Defaulters and keyboard warriors will be removed from the community.
This website is meant to be used as an educational tool, as well as a platform to connect with art enthusiasts. Any malicious use of the resources and features provided in this website could result in strict action against the persecutors.


Significance
Our website provides an opportunity for both culturally aware and unaware users to explore the intricacies of our country’s ancient artifacts.
Preserves cultural heritage by providing insights into the knowledge, history, and science behind the traditional artifacts.
Enable users to learn and practice traditional crafting techniques through interactive, hands-on simulations.
Foster a global community where artisans and learners can connect, share knowledge, and celebrate cultural diversity.
Utilize gamification elements to engage users and sustain interest in cultural learning and crafting practices.
Hence this is an attempt to revive the antique traditions which are at the brink of extinction.

Uniqueness
Interactive Simulations: Offers realistic hands-on crafting experiences, unlike traditional learning platforms.
Guided Creation: Provides step-by-step instructions to build the model from scratch providing the users freedom to innovate during the tutorial.
Gamified Learning: Incorporates game mechanics to enhance user engagement and motivation, with leaderboards for each model to instill competitiveness, hence promoting innovation.
Community-Driven Content: The striking feature of the project, where users and communities across the world can spread awareness about their traditions
